### Hi from Skippr ðŸ‘‹

Skippr is a universal data integration and format converter.

#### Getting Started

Docker example, converting a json file to parquet

https://docs.skippr.io/getting-started/docker/

#### The Goal

Any data source to any destination in any format. 

Skippr solves the EL in ELT, increasing time-to-value and reducing ingestion pipeline failures.

#### Why?

Engineers intend to spend 80% of their time deriving value from data. Instead we spend 80% of our time integrating and fixing pipelines.


#### Core Featues

* very simple input/output plugins
* schema discovery and evolution
* full support for nested data
* convert data formats between destinations

#### Open Core

We're working to open source the core skipprd service.

For now, please checkout:

* Skippr Docker [skippr/skipprd](https://hub.docker.com/r/skippr/skipprd)
* The enterprise ready [Skippr.io plaform](https://skippr.io/)
* [Engineering Docs](https://docs.skippr.io/)
